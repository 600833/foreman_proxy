# SSL Setup

# if enabled, all communication would be verfied via SSL
# NOTE that both certificates need to be signed by the same CA in order for this to work
# see http://theforeman.org/projects/smart-proxy/wiki/SSL for more information

# HTTP ports configuration
# http is disabled by default. To enable, uncomment 'http_port' setting
